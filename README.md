### Hi, I'm Rafael Lima!

I'm a Front-end Developer with VueJs and ReactJs, Back-end Developer with NodeJs, and Mobile Developer with Flutter.

I'm passionate about technology, an enthusiast... My goal is to develop relevant software that helps society in some way. There is a long way to go, but it doesn't matter if the walk is long, the important thing is to keep going.
